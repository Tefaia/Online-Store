Ecommerce website with sanity and strip

This is a modern, full-stack, responsive e-commerce application with payment capability. With a contemporary design, animations, the ability to add and change products while on the go using a content management system, all cutting-edge cart features, and most crucially, a full integration with Stripe so that it can handle REAL payments.

Advanced React Best Practices are used, like hooks and refs, as well as file and folder organization. Using React Context API, the application's overall advanced state management. I used Next.js as a backend endpoint since it has Best Practices like File-based routing, Data fetching that enables server-side rendering, and static generation that makes your websites very streamlined (display getServerSideProps, getStaticPaths, and getStaticProps).

To control payments, items, shipping costs, and the full checkout process, I incorporated Stripe. I can use Sanity to control all of the material in my app. The platform for unified content known as Sanity will enable us to create our complete app. Clientâ€™s will be able to quickly and conveniently alter the homepage of the business through Sanity, as well as all of the product information.

Sanity frees us from having to worry about the content, file storage, and databases so that we can concentrate on creating the application. We can simply create contemporary, scalable web apps for e-commerce thanks to sanity.
